# Project 1: Out of this World

This project involved creating responsive and dynamic data visualizations using exoplanet data from the exoplanet archive and D3.js.

## Data

The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). The data includes information about the planetary systems such as the star name, the number of planets in the system, the planet mass, radius, period, etc.

## Tools

The visualization project was created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a popular JavaScript library for data visualization. D3.js provides a set of tools for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations on the web.

Other tools used in this project include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

This visualization project includes the following features:

- Barcharts: There are five dynamic barcharts that users can interact with.

- Line chart: Users can view and interact with a timeline of exoplanet discoveries by year.

- Scatterplot: Users can view and interact with a visualization of the relationship between exoplanet mass and radius.

- Histogram: Users can view a categorization of exoplanets by their distance in parsecs.

- Data Table: Users can view and interact with the exoplanet data in a table format.

- Host System Simulation: Users can view a simulation of a host star system.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The data will be loaded automatically and the visualizations will be displayed on the screen.

## Credits

This project was created by Adam Jarvis for  course. The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) and the visualizations were created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
