Project 1 aims to develop interactive and dynamic data visualizations using exoplanet data from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

Check out the [documentation](https://sites.google.com/view/adam-jarvis/out-of-this-world) on the project site to learn more about the design and development process.

## Data

The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

## Tools

The visualizations included in this project were created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

This project was developed using primarily JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

This project includes the following visualizations:

- Barcharts: Users can view and interact with five dynamic barcharts.

- Line chart: Users can view and interact with a timeline of exoplanet discoveries by year.

- Scatterplot: Users can view and interact with a visualization of the relationship between exoplanet mass and radius.

- Histogram: Users can view a categorization of exoplanets by their distance in parsecs.

- Data Table: Users can view and interact with the exoplanet data in a table format.

- Host System Simulation: Users can view a scale model of an exoplanet's solar system.

# Usage

To run this project locally, clone the `main` branch of this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The data will be loaded automatically and the visualizations will be displayed on the screen.

This project is also accessible through the [project site](https://sites.google.com/view/adam-jarvis/out-of-this-world/project-1-deployment).

# Credits

This project was created by Adam Jarvis for CS5124 Visual Interfaces Data. The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) and the visualizations were created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
