# Project 1: Out of this World

This is a simple data visualization webpage that utilizes exoplanet data from the exoplanet archive and D3.js to create dynamic barcharts, line chart, scatterplot, histogram, data table, and star system simulation.

## Data

The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). The data includes information about the planetary systems such as the star name, the number of planets in the system, the planet mass, radius, period, etc.

## Tools

The visualization project was created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a popular JavaScript library for data visualization. D3.js provides a set of tools for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations on the web.

Other tools used in this project include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

This visualization project includes the following features:

- Barcharts: There are five dynamic barcharts that users can interact with.

- Line chart: Users can view a timeline of exoplanet discoveries by year.

- Scatterplot: Users can view a visualization of the relationship between exoplanet mass and radius.

- Histogram: Users can view a categorization of exoplanets by their distance from us.

- Data table: Users can view the data for each planetary system in a table format.

- Star system simulation: Users can view a simulation of a star system.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The data will be loaded automatically and the visualizations will be displayed on the screen.

This project is also accessible through [GitHub Pages](http://jarvisar.github.io/datavis-project1)
