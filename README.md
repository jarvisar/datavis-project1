# Project 1: Out of this World

This project aims to develop interactive and dynamic data visualizations using exoplanet data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and D3.js.

Check out the [documentation](https://sites.google.com/view/adam-jarvis/out-of-this-world) on the project site to learn more about the design and development process.

## Data

The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

## Tools

The visualization project was created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a popular JavaScript library for data visualization. D3.js provides a set of tools for creating interactive and dynamic data visualizations.

This project was developed using primarily JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

This project includes the following visualizations:

- Barcharts: Users can view and interact with five dynamic barcharts.

- Line chart: Users can view and interact with a timeline of exoplanet discoveries by year.

- Scatterplot: Users can view and interact with a visualization of the relationship between exoplanet mass and radius.

- Histogram: Users can view a categorization of exoplanets by their distance in parsecs.

- Data Table: Users can view and interact with the exoplanet data in a table format.

- Host System Simulation: Users can view a simulation of a host star system.

## Usage

To run this project locally, clone the `main` branch of this repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The data will be loaded automatically and the visualizations will be displayed on the screen.

This project is also accessible through [GitHub Pages](http://jarvisar.github.io/datavis-project1)

## Credits

This project was created by Adam Jarvis for CS 5124. The exoplanet data used in this project was obtained from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/) and the visualizations were created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
